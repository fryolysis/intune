# InTune
The defacto tuning for almost all contemporary western music is 12 tone equal temperament. It is a good solution given the constraint that tuning an instrument in real-time during the performance and even between different musical pieces in a single performence can be a tedious task. The most famous example is probably the piano where the tuning requires a separate profession.

We believe that 12 tone equal temperament is not necessarily the best tuning system for every melody if retuning is an easy operation like in electronic music. InTune aims to compute a better tuning tailored to a given musical piece. For more details, please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/fryolysis/intune/wiki) of the project.
